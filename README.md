# ProfessionalPortfolio

Description
This is a professional portfolio for Matt to provide to potential employers. It has examples of projects and links to pages that Matt has contributed to or created.

Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Installation
N/A

Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

Support
e-mail Matt @ matthew.tomchik@yahoo.com with any isses

Roadmap
Eventually this website will be fully interactive utilizing all the skills learned frm the coding bootcamp through DU.
